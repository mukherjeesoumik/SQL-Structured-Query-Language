# DDL-DQL-DML-DCL-and-TCL-Commands

## 1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
DDL commands are used to define and manage database structures such as tables, indexes, and schemas. They are responsible for setting up the schema and defining the data structures.

Common DDL commands:
```cs

CREATE: Used to create new tables, views, or databases.

ALTER: Used to modify existing database objects like tables.

DROP: Used to delete tables, views, or databases.

TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table without deleting the table itself.


```
## 2. DQL (Data Query Language)
DQL commands are used to query the database and retrieve data. The primary command in this category is SELECT.

Common DQL command:
```cs
SELECT: Used to fetch data from one or more tables.

```

## 3. DML (Data Manipulation Language) 
DML commands are used for manipulating data in existing database objects. These commands deal with data manipulation and are responsible for the actual data stored in the database.

INSERT: Used to add new data into a table. 

UPDATE: Used to modify existing data within a table.  

DELETE: Used to remove data from a table.
```
## 4. DCL (Data Control Language)
DCL commands deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. They are used to control access to data.

Common DCL commands:
```cs
GRANT: Used to provide users with access privileges to the database.

REVOKE: Used to remove user access privileges granted by the GRANT command.

```

## 5. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. They ensure the integrity of data and manage changes to the database.

Common TCL commands:

```cs

COMMIT: Used to save all changes made in the current transaction.

ROLLBACK: Used to undo the changes made in the current transaction.

SAVEPOINT: Used to set a savepoint within a transaction, allowing for partial rollbacks.

SET TRANSACTION: Used to specify characteristics for the transaction.

```

# Structured Query Language

### Example 1: Simple SELECT Query
Fetch all data from the employees table.

```cs
SELECT *
FROM employees;
```
### Example 2: SELECT with WHERE Clause
Fetch all employees who are SALESMAN.

```cs
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE JOB = 'SALESMAN';
```
### Example 3: SELECT with ORDER BY
Fetch all employees and order them by salary in descending order.

```cs
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY SAL DESC;
```
fetch all employees and order them by salary in ascending order, you would use the ASC keyword instead of DESC. Hereâ€™s the correct query:
```cs
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY SAL ASC;
```
### Example 4: SELECT with GROUP BY and HAVING
Fetch the total salary for each department, but only include departments where the total salary is greater than 10,000.
```cs
SELECT DEPTNO, SUM(SAL) as total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY DEPTNO
HAVING SUM(SAL) > 10000;
```
### Example 5: SELECT with Aggregate Functions
Fetch the average salary and the count of employees in each department.

```cs
SELECT DEPTNO, AVG(SAL) as average_salary, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY DEPTNO;
```
### Example 6: SELECT with LIMIT
Fetch the top 5 employees with the highest salary.

```cs
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY SAL DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
### Example 7: UPDATE Query
Update the salary of employees in the 'SALES' department by increasing it by 10%.

```cs
UPDATE employees
SET SAL = SAL * 1.10
WHERE DEPTNO = 30;
```
### Example 8: DELETE Query
Delete all employees from the 'CLERK' job.

```cs
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE JOB = 'CLERK';
```
### Example 9: Using Arithmetic Operators
Calculate the total compensation (salary + commission) for each employee.

```cs
SELECT 
    EMPNO, 
    ENAME, 
    JOB,
    SAL + COALESCE(COMM, 0) AS total_compensation
FROM 
    employees;
```
### Example 10: Using Comparison Operators
Fetch all employees where the salary is greater than 2000.

```cs
SELECT 
    EMPNO, 
    ENAME, 
    JOB,
    SAL
FROM 
    employees
WHERE 
    SAL > 2000;
```
### Example 11: Using Logical Operators
Fetch all employees who are either MANAGER or their salary is greater than 2500.

```cs
SELECT 
    EMPNO, 
    ENAME, 
    JOB,
    SAL
FROM 
    employees
WHERE 
    JOB = 'MANAGER' OR SAL > 2500;
```
### Example 12: Using String Operators
Concatenate employee name and job title.

```cs
SELECT 
    EMPNO, 
    ENAME || ' - ' || JOB AS employee_details
FROM 
    employees;
```
### Example 13: Using BETWEEN Operator
Fetch all employees whose salary is between 1000 and 3000.

```cs
SELECT 
    EMPNO, 
    ENAME, 
    JOB,
    SAL
FROM 
    employees
WHERE 
    SAL BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000;
```
### Example 14: Using IN Operator
Fetch all employees who are in department 10, 20, or 30.

```cs
SELECT 
    EMPNO, 
    ENAME, 
    JOB,
    SAL
FROM 
    employees
WHERE 
    DEPTNO IN (10, 20, 30);
```
### Example 15: Using LIKE and OR Operators
Fetch all employees whose names contain 'SMITH' or 'KING'.

```cs
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE ENAME LIKE '%SMITH%' OR ENAME LIKE '%KING%';
```


# SUBQUERY in SQL are queries nested inside another query


### 1. Single-row Subquery
A single-row subquery returns only one row. Example:

```cs
SELECT ENAME, JOB
FROM employees
WHERE SAL = (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM employees);
```
Explanation: This query retrieves the name and job of the employee with the highest salary.

### 2. Multiple-row Subquery
A multiple-row subquery returns multiple rows. Example:

```cs
SELECT ENAME, JOB
FROM employees
WHERE DEPTNO IN (SELECT DEPTNO FROM employees WHERE SAL > 2500);
```
Explanation: This query retrieves the names and jobs of employees who are in departments where at least one employee earns more than 2500.

### 3. Correlated Subquery
A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query. Example:

```cs
SELECT ENAME, SAL
FROM employees e1
WHERE SAL > (SELECT AVG(SAL) FROM employees e2 WHERE e2.DEPTNO = e1.DEPTNO);
```
Explanation: This query retrieves the names and salaries of employees who earn more than the average salary in their department.

### 4. Scalar Subquery
A scalar subquery returns a single value. Example:

```cs
SELECT ENAME, SAL, (SELECT DEPTNAME FROM departments WHERE DEPTNO = e.DEPTNO) AS DEPTNAME
FROM employees e;
```
Explanation: This query retrieves the names, salaries, and department names of employees.

### 5. Subquery in the FROM Clause
A subquery can be used in the FROM clause as a derived table. Example:

```cs
SELECT DEPTNO, AVG(SAL) as avg_salary
FROM (SELECT DEPTNO, SAL FROM employees WHERE JOB = 'CLERK') sub
GROUP BY DEPTNO;
```
Explanation: This query calculates the average salary of clerks in each department.

### 6. Subquery in the SELECT Clause
A subquery can be used in the SELECT clause to return a value for each row. Example:

```cs
SELECT ENAME, SAL, (SELECT AVG(SAL) FROM employees WHERE DEPTNO = e.DEPTNO) AS dept_avg_salary
FROM employees e;
```
Explanation: This query retrieves the names, salaries, and average salary of the employees' departments.

### 7. Subquery with EXISTS
The EXISTS keyword is used to check if a subquery returns any rows. Example:

```cs
SELECT ENAME, JOB
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE MGR = e.EMPNO);
```
Explanation: This query retrieves the names and jobs of employees who are managers.

### 8. Subquery with ANY and ALL
The ANY and ALL keywords are used to compare a value to any or all values in a subquery. Example with ANY:

```
SELECT ENAME, SAL
FROM employees
WHERE SAL > ANY (SELECT SAL FROM employees WHERE JOB = 'CLERK');
```
Explanation: This query retrieves the names and salaries of employees who earn more than any clerk.

### Example with ALL:

```cs
SELECT ENAME, SAL
FROM employees
WHERE SAL > ALL (SELECT SAL FROM employees WHERE JOB = 'CLERK');
```
Explanation: This query retrieves the names and salaries of employees who earn more than all clerks.
